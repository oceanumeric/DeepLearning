# Activation Functions 


## Introduction 

After the innovation like ChatGPT, I begun to think about the fundamentals of deep learning models. In the old days (I mean three to five years ago), I had some doubt on deep learning models as there is lack of theoretical support. Compared to traditional machine learning and statistcal models, deep learning models are more like black boxes. However, somehow it works and it is creating a lot of impact in the industry.

Therefore, I updated my perception on deep learning models. Instread of caring a lot about the theoretical support, I think it is more important to understand the mechanism of deep learning models. It is better to think about the deep learning models as a nerual network architecture that could map data from one space to another space. 

With this perspective, one could understand how two architectures have changed our world. One is the word2vec model, which maps words from one space to another space. The other is the transformer model, which maps sentences from one space to another space. As the famous paper stated, the attention is all we need. 

In this article, I will talk about the activation functions. Since activation functions are the core of deep learning models, I think it is important to understand the mechanism of activation functions.
